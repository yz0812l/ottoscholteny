# zoomChatBot
My first python script, an attempt at a chatbot for zoom. 

Currently don't have time to clean up the script. Hoping to clean it up, and python experts please help me clean it up. (I am eager to learn!)

Missing functionalities:
- Assign users when there are more than 8 people. Add scroll or search, when there are more than 8 users, it becomes a list with a search). Currently this feature is the one last element I need to get it to work for big calls.
